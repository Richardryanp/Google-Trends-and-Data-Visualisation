# 📊 Google Trends & Data Visualisation

This project explores whether **Google search interest** can indicate or relate to real-world trends such as **stock prices**, **cryptocurrency movements**, and **unemployment rates**.
Using simple **pandas** and **matplotlib**, the notebook loads CSV files, cleans the data, and visualises how search popularity compares to economic and financial time-series data.
